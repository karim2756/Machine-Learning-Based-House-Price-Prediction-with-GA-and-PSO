# 🏡 Machine Learning-Based House Price Prediction with GA and PSO

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on a variety of property features. It also uses two evolutionary algorithms—**Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**—for feature selection to evaluate if reducing the number of features can enhance model performance.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Predict house prices using machine learning models.
- Use GA and PSO to select the most relevant features.
- Compare model performance with and without feature selection.
- Evaluate results using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
